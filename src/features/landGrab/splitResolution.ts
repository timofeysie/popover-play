/**
 * Split/cut resolution: the `numIslands` scan from
 * docs/problems/Number-of-Islands.md, restricted to one player's owned
 * cells. When an opponent's capture loop (or a dead rival's plowed-through
 * trail reverting to neutral) severs this player's territory, what's left can
 * fall into more than one connected component — same "scan every cell,
 * DFS-sink each new component you find" outer loop as the doc's `numIslands`,
 * just counting this player's land instead of every `'1'`.
 *
 * One component is kept — the rest are what the cut orphaned from the player,
 * and revert to neutral ground (fair game for anyone to claim). The keeper is
 * the component holding the player's piece: `anchors` lists candidate keep
 * points in priority order (head first, then home/base), and the first anchor
 * that lands inside a component wins. If the player owns none of their anchors
 * — their base was captured long ago and they're currently trailing through
 * open ground — the largest remaining component is kept as a best effort so a
 * roaming leader isn't wiped out by a nick somewhere on the map.
